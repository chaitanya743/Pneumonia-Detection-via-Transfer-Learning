# Pneumonia Prediction Using Hybrid Neural Networks

## Project Description

**Pneumonia Prediction Using Hybrid Neural Networks** is a deep learning project aimed at improving the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis from chest X-ray images. This project integrates three advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50—into a hybrid model to leverage their strengths for superior performance in detecting pneumonia.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves a training accuracy of 99.99% and a validation accuracy of 98.51%.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Utilizes feature concatenation, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation for improved model performance.
